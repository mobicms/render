**mobicms/render is a native PHP template system** that started on the basis of [league/plates v.3.3.0](https://github.com/thephpleague/plates/releases/tag/3.3.0).
The development of the original package went in a direction that was not suitable for our projects where Plates was used, so it was decided to develop our own separate library.
Our goal was to simplify the source code as much as possible, get rid of the unnecessary and add the missing functionality.

[![KISS](https://img.shields.io/badge/principle-KISS-blue.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)  
In our development, we follow the principles of [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAGNI) and [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle).  
The source code should not have extra unnecessary functionality and should be as simple and efficient as possible.
